title: PACE Model Documentation
---

The ICCTâ€™s PACE model is a global aviation emissions model. The PACE model is intended to help policymakers worldwide to identify and understand trends in the aviation sector, assess emission impacts of different policy options, and frame plans to effectively reduce emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local air pollutants. It is designed to allow transparent, customizable estimation of aviation emissions for a broad range of policy cases.

## Versions

PACE is under continuing development. Documentation of all versions since v1.0 can be found here.
